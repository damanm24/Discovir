# Discovir

Discovir is an experiment to test the ideas behind graph based recommender systems. The idea is by taking a list of artists you most recently listened to, a listening profile can be generated and then compared to other users who have also used the site. One can then get recommendations by listing aritsts that similar users have listened to, but you might not have.
